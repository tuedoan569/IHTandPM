STL Object - Vector

I chose vector because it provides an unlimited length of elements and random element access. Sort is one of the project requirements, and vector does not have sort function. However, the sort function is already available in 'SortSearch.h'. 
I didn't choose arrays because it has fixed element size at compile time. 
I also didn't choose list because it lacks direct access to the elements and consumes more extra memory as the list get larger. 

Here is what I tested with-
1. An empty file
2. File with one string 
3. File with two strings
4. File with many strings
5. Script
